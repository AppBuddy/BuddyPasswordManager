# Buddy Password Manager

A simple password manager created in 2013.

## Setup Requirements

1. Java 21
2. Maven 3+

## Compiling & Running

The best way to deal with this project is to use Intellij. Yes, I know that's not optimal, but it's the quickest way to
get up and running.

If you want to compile this in your terminal use the command:

`mvn clean package`

This will clean previous builds, compile code, and run test.

For running, again I highly recommend you use Intellij. You can just hit the green play button and the application should
run. Make sure the below is set to the main class.
